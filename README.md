# osTicket-Exploration
Practical Use of osTicket

## Introduction
This project involved setting up an osTicket system for a fictional company, Americorp, aimed at providing public service. The focus was on simulating a real-world ticketing environment, inspired by Active Directory principles.

## Structure and Setup
- In the osTicket setup for Americorp, I created a total of 12 users and organized them into six distinct departments reflective of a typical IT department in a real-world company. These departments include Support, Feedback and Improvement, Helpdesk Support, Network Performance and Monitoring, Security and Compliance, and Technical Issues.
- Each department was structured with a specific team comprising two users. This team size was chosen to simulate a balance between efficient workload distribution and effective collaboration. For instance, the Support team was tasked with overarching system management, while the Feedback and Improvement team focused on analyzing user feedback to enhance service quality.
- The decision to include these particular departments was driven by their relevance and importance in a standard IT operation, ensuring that the Americorp simulation covered a broad spectrum of IT functionalities. This organizational structure provided valuable insights into the dynamics of IT support and service management, closely mirroring the intricacies of a real-world business setup.

## Ticket Lifecycle and Assignment Process
- **Ticket Creation:** Clients create tickets with a summary and detailed issue description.
- **Automated Assignment:** Based on urgency and content, tickets are auto-assigned to respective departments.

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- **SLA Levels:**
  - Severity A (Urgent): Resolution within 24 working hours.
  - Severity B (Normal): Resolution within 48 working hours.
  - Severity C (Non-Urgent): Resolution within 72 working hours.

## Client Interaction and Help Topics
- **Help Topics for Ticket Categorization:** Critical Error, Feedback, General Inquiry, and Report a Problem.
- **Client Experience:** Streamlined submission process with clear categorization for issue reporting.

## Auto-Generated Responses
- **Communication Efficiency:** Utilized built-in osTicket auto-response features to enhance communication with clients and staff.

## Simulation and Testing
- **Ticket Management:** Created and managed tickets from the client side to simulate real-world operations.
- **Agent Role-Play:** Logged in as an agent to view, reassign, and follow up on tickets.

## Conclusion and Learnings
Reflecting on the project, I gained valuable insights into the setup and management of a ticketing system. This experience highlighted the importance of strategic planning, efficient categorization, and effective communication in a client-focused environment.
