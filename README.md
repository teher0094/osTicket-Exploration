# osTicket Implementation for Simulated Public Service â€“ Americorp

## Introduction
This project involved setting up an osTicket system for a fictional company, Americorp, aimed at providing public service. The focus was on simulating a real-world ticketing environment, inspired by Active Directory principles.

## Structure and Setup
- **Departments and Teams:** Structured the system into six departments: Feedback and Improvement, Helpdesk Support, Network Performance Monitoring, Security and Compliance, Technical Issues, and Support.
- **Role of Departments:**
  - Feedback and Improvement: Analyzing user feedback to improve services.
  - Helpdesk Support: First point of contact for general queries.
  - Network Performance Monitoring: Ensuring network reliability and performance.
  - Security and Compliance: Managing network and data security.
  - Technical Issues: Addressing advanced technical concerns.

## System Administration and Oversight
- **Support Department:**
  - Comprised of 2 admins with system-wide access and configuration capabilities.
  - Responsible for overseeing the entire ticketing process and system settings.

## Ticket Lifecycle and Assignment Process
- **Ticket Creation:** Clients create tickets with a summary and detailed issue description.
- **Automated Assignment:** Based on urgency and content, tickets are auto-assigned to respective departments.

## Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- **SLA Levels:**
  - Severity A (Urgent): Resolution within 24 working hours.
  - Severity B (Normal): Resolution within 48 working hours.
  - Severity C (Non-Urgent): Resolution within 72 working hours.

## Client Interaction and Help Topics
- **Help Topics for Ticket Categorization:** Critical Error, Feedback, General Inquiry, and Report a Problem.
- **Client Experience:** Streamlined submission process with clear categorization for issue reporting.

## Auto-Generated Responses
- **Communication Efficiency:** Utilized built-in osTicket auto-response features to enhance communication with clients and staff.

## Simulation and Testing
- **Ticket Management:** Created and managed tickets from the client side to simulate real-world operations.
- **Agent Role-Play:** Logged in as an agent to view, reassign, and follow up on tickets.

## Conclusion and Learnings
Reflecting on the project, I gained valuable insights into the setup and management of a ticketing system. This experience highlighted the importance of strategic planning, efficient categorization, and effective communication in a client-focused environment.
